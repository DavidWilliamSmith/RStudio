#14

Consider the following vectors representing the number of three-pointers made and attempted by a basketball player in five games:

Three-Pointers Made: c(4, 5, 3, 6, 7) 

Three-Pointers Attempted: c(9, 10, 8, 11, 12)

Calculate the three-point shooting percentage for each game and select the correct average three-point shooting percentage for the five games.

```{r}
# Define the vectors representing the number of three-pointers made and attempted
three_made <- c(4, 5, 3, 6, 7)
three_attempted <- c(9, 10, 8, 11, 12)

# Calculate the shooting percentage for each game
shooting_percentage <- (three_made / three_attempted) * 100

# Print the shooting percentage for each game
cat("Shooting Percentage for each game:", shooting_percentage, "\n")

# Calculate the average shooting percentage for the five games
avg_shooting_percentage <- mean(shooting_percentage)


# Print the average shooting percentage
cat("Average Shooting Percentage:", avg_shooting_percentage)
```
