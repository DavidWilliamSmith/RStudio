Consider the following dataset representing the performance of baseball players in a season. It includes the following variables: PlayerID, Hits, At-Bats, Home Runs (HR), Walks (BB), and Strikeouts (SO).

PlayerID     Hits    At-Bats  HR  BB SO

    1        120       400    15   4080

    2        140       450          12          50     75

    3        110       380     8            30    60

    4        160       500     20          60     90

    5        130       420     10          45     70

Compute the on-base percentage (OBP) for each player and select the player with the highest OBP.

a) Player 1 b) Player 2 c) Player 3 d) Player 4 e) Player 5

To calculate OBP, you can use the following formula:

OBP = (Hits + Walks) / (At-Bats + Walks).

```{r}
# Define the dataset
dataset <- data.frame(
  PlayerID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  Hits = c(120, 140, 110, 160, 130),
  At_Bats = c(400, 450, 380, 500, 420),
  HR = c(15, 12, 8, 20, 10),
  BB = c(40, 50, 30, 60, 45),
  SO = c(80, 75, 60, 90, 70)
)

# Calculate OBP for each player
dataset$OBP <- (dataset$Hits + dataset$BB) / (dataset$At_Bats + dataset$BB)

# Find the player with the highest OBP
player_with_highest_OBP <- dataset$PlayerID[which.max(dataset$OBP)]

# Print the result
print(player_with_highest_OBP)


```
